## Getting started

1. You need a Bluemix account. If you don't have one, [sign up][sign_up].

2. Download and install the [Cloud-foundry CLI][cloud_foundry] tool if you haven't already.

3. Edit the `manifest.yml` file and change `<application-name>` to something unique. The name you use determines the URL of your application. For example, `<application-name>.mybluemix.net`.

  ```yaml
  applications:
  - services:
    - my-nlu-service
    name: <application-name>
    command: npm start
    path: .
    memory: 512M
  ```

4. Connect to Bluemix with the command line tool.

  ```sh
  cf api https://api.ng.bluemix.net
  cf login
  ```

5. Create and retrieve service keys to access the [Natural Language Understanding][service_url] service:

  ```none
  cf create-service natural-language-understanding free my-nlu-service
  cf create-service-key my-nlu-service myKey
  cf service-key my-nlu-service myKey
  ```

6. Create a `.env` file in the root directory by copying the sample `.env.example` file using the following command:

  ```none
  cp .env.example .env
  ```
  You will update the `.env` with the information you retrieved in steps 5.

  The `.env` file will look something like the following:

  ```none
  NATURAL_LANGUAGE_UNDERSTANDING_USERNAME=<username>
  NATURAL_LANGUAGE_UNDERSTANDING_PASSWORD=<password>
  ```

7. Install the dependencies you application need:

  ```none
  npm install
  ```

  ```

9. Point your browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

10. **Optional:** Push the application to Bluemix:

  ```none
  cf push
  ```

After completing the steps above, you are ready to test your application. Start a browser and enter the URL of your application.

            <your application name>.mybluemix.net
